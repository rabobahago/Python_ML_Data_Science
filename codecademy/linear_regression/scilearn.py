# Luckily, we don’t have to do this every time we want to use linear regression.
# We can use Python’s scikit-learn library. Scikit-learn, or sklearn, is used
# specifically for Machine Learning. Inside the linear_model module, there is a LinearRegression() function we can use:
# from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
# You can first create a LinearRegression model, and then fit it to your x and y data:
# line_fitter = LinearRegression()
# line_fitter.fit(X, y)
# The .fit() method gives the model two variables that are useful to us:
# the line_fitter.coef_, which contains the slope
# the line_fitter.intercept_, which contains the intercept
# We can also use the .predict() function to pass in x-values and receive the y-values that this line would predict:
# y_predicted = line_fitter.predict(X)
# Note: the num_iterations and the learning_rate that you learned about in your own implementation have default
# values within scikit-learn, so you don’t need to worry about setting them specifically!
# Instructions
# We have imported a dataset of soup sales data vs temperature.
# Run the code to see the scatterplot. Can you envision the line that would fit this data?
# Create an sklearn linear regression model and call it line_fitter.
# We have imported the sklearn LinearRegression() function that
# creates a model. Call this function and assign the result to line_fitter.
# Fit the line_fitter object to temperature and sales.
# You can use the .fit() method of line_fitter. Just pass in temperature and sales as the parameters.
# Create a list called sales_predict that is the predicted sales values that
# line_fitter would generate from the temperature list.
# You can use the .predict() method of line_fitter. Pass in temperature
# as the parameter, and call the result sales_predict.
# Plot sales_predict against temperature as a line, on the same plot as the scatterplot.
