# We have all of the functions we have defined throughout the lesson.
# Now, let’s create a function called gradient_descent() that takes in x, y, learning_rate, and a num_iterations
# For now, return [-1,-1].
# In the function gradient_descent(), create variables b and m and set them both to zero for our initial guess.
# Return b and m from the function.
# Update your step_gradient() function to take in the parameter learning_rate (as the last parameter)
# and replace the 0.01s in the calculations of b_gradient and m_gradient with learning_rate.
# Your b_gradient should now be calculated like:
# b = b_current - (learning_rate * b_gradient)
# Let’s go back and finish the gradient_descent() function.
# Create a loop that runs num_iterations times. At each step, it should:
# Call step_gradient() with b, m, x, y, and learning_rate
# Update the values of b and m with the values step_gradient() returns.
# Outside of the function, uncomment the line that calls
# gradient_descent on months and revenue, with a learning rate of 0.01 and 1000 iterations.
# It stores the results in variables called b and m.
# Uncomment the lines that will plot the result to the browser.
