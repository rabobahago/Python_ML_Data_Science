# To set the scene, so to speak, we’ll discuss what AI is, how it can be defined, and
# what other fields or technologies are closely related. Before we do so, however,
# we’ll highlight three applications of AI that illustrate different aspects of AI.
# We’ll return to each of them throughout the course to deepen our understanding.

# 1) Self-driving Cars
# 2) Content Recommendation
# 3) Images and Video Processing

# Two words are very important in AI world
# Autonomy: Ability to perform complex without supervision from a user
#Adaptivity: Ability to improve performance by learning from experience

# Watch out for “suitcase words”
# Marvin Minsky, a cognitive scientist and one of the greatest pioneers in AI, coined
# the term suitcase word for terms that carry a whole bunch of different meanings that
# come along even if we intend only one of them. Using such terms increases the risk of
# misinterpretations such as the ones above.
