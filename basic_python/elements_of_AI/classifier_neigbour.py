# The nearest neighbor classifier
# The nearest neighbor classifier is among the simplest possible classifiers.
# When given an item to classify, it finds the training data item that is most
# similar to the new item, and outputs its label. An example is given in the following diagram.

#nearest classification:This uses input data to predict the label(text output)
#linear regression: This uses the input data to predict the output in terms of numerical
#logistic regression: This uses the input data to predict the output in terms of label representing numbers
