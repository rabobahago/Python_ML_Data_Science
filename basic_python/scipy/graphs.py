# Working with Graphs
# Graphs are an essential data structure.
# SciPy provides us with the module scipy.sparse.csgraph for working with such data structures.
# Adjacency Matrix
# Adjacency matrix is a nxn matrix where n is the number of elements in a graph.
# And the values represents the connection between the elements.
# For a graph like this, with elements A, B and C, the connections are:
# A & B are connected with weight 1.
# A & C are connected with weight 2.
# C & B is not connected.
# The Adjency Matrix would look like this:
#       A B C
#    A:[0 1 2]
#    B:[1 0 0]
#    C:[2 0 0]

# Below follows some of the most used methods for working with adjacency matrices.
# Connected Components
# Find all of the connected components with the connected_components() method.
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse.csgraph import connected_components
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix

arr = np.array([
  [0, 1, 2],
  [1, 0, 0],
  [2, 0, 0]
])
newarr = csr_matrix(arr)
print(connected_components(newarr))


# Dijkstra
# Use the dijkstra method to find the shortest path in a graph from one element to another.
# It takes following arguments:
# return_predecessors: boolean (True to return whole path of traversal otherwise False).
# indices: index of the element to return all paths from that element only.
# limit: max weight of path.
# Find the shortest path from element 1 to 2:

import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse.csgraph import dijkstra
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
arr = np.array([
  [0, 1, 2],
  [1, 0, 0],
  [2, 0, 0]
])
newarr = csr_matrix(arr)
print(dijkstra(newarr, return_predecessors=True, indices=0))

# Floyd Warshall
# Use the floyd_warshall() method to find shortest path between all pairs of elements.
# Find the shortest path between all pairs of elements:

import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse.csgraph import floyd_warshall
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
arr = np.array([
  [0, 1, 2],
  [1, 0, 0],
  [2, 0, 0]
])
newarr = csr_matrix(arr)
print(floyd_warshall(newarr, return_predecessors=True))
# Bellman Ford
# The bellman_ford() method can also find the shortest path between
# all pairs of elements, but this method can handle negative weights as well.
# Example
# Find shortest path from element 1 to 2 with given graph with a negative weight:
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse.csgraph import bellman_ford
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
arr = np.array([
  [0, -1, 2],
  [1, 0, 0],
  [2, 0, 0]
])
newarr = csr_matrix(arr)
print(bellman_ford(newarr, return_predecessors=True, indices=0))
# Depth First Order
# The depth_first_order() method returns a depth first traversal from a node.
# This function takes following arguments
# the graph.
# the starting element to traverse graph from.
# Traverse the graph depth first for given adjacency matrix:

import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse.csgraph import depth_first_order
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
arr = np.array([
  [0, 1, 0, 1],
  [1, 1, 1, 1],
  [2, 1, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 1]
])
newarr = csr_matrix(arr)
print(depth_first_order(newarr, 1))
# Breadth First Order
# The breadth_first_order() method returns a breadth first traversal from a node.
# This function takes following arguments:
# the graph.
# the starting element to traverse graph from.
# Traverse the graph breadth first for given adjacency matrix:

import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse.csgraph import breadth_first_order
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
arr = np.array([
  [0, 1, 0, 1],
  [1, 1, 1, 1],
  [2, 1, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 1]
])
newarr = csr_matrix(arr)
print(breadth_first_order(newarr, 1))
