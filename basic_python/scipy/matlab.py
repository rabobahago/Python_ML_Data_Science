# Working With Matlab Arrays
# We know that NumPy provides us with methods to persist the data in readable formats for Python.
# But SciPy provides us with interoperability with Matlab as well.
# SciPy provides us with the module scipy.io, which has functions for working with Matlab arrays.
# Exporting Data in Matlab Format
# The savemat() function allows us to export data in Matlab format.
# The method takes the following parameters:
# filename - the file name for saving data.
# mdict - a dictionary containing the data.
# do_compression - a boolean value that specifies whether to compress the result or not. Default False.
# Export the following array as variable name "vec" to a mat file:

from scipy import io
import numpy as np
arr = np.arange(10)
io.savemat('arr.mat', {"vec": arr})
# Note: The example above saves a file name "arr.mat" on your computer.
# To open the file, check out the "Import Data from Matlab Format" example below:
# Import Data from Matlab Format
# The loadmat() function allows us to import data from a Matlab file.
# The function takes one required parameter:
# filename - the file name of the saved data.
# It will return a structured array whose keys are the variable names, and the corresponding values are the variable values.
# Import the array from following mat file.:

from scipy import io
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,])
# Export:
io.savemat('arr.mat', {"vec": arr})
# Import:
mydata = io.loadmat('arr.mat')
print(mydata)
