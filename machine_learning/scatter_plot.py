# Scatter Plot
# A scatter plot is a diagram where each value in the data set is represented by a dot.

# The Matplotlib module has a method for drawing scatter plots, it needs two arrays of the same
# length, one for the values of the x-axis, and one for the values of the y-axis:
# x = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]
# y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]
# The x array represents the age of each car.
# The y array represents the speed of each car.

#Use the scatter() method to draw a scatter plot diagram:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]
y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.show()
