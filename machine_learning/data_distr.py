# Data Distribution
# Earlier in this tutorial we have worked with very small amounts of data in our examples,
# just to understand the different concepts.In the real world, the data sets are much bigger,
# but it can be difficult to gather real world data, at least at an early stage of a project.
# How Can we Get Big Data Sets?
# To create big data sets for testing, we use the Python module NumPy, which comes with a number
# of methods to create random data sets, of any size.
import numpy

#Create an array containing 250 random floats between 0 and 5:
x = numpy.random.uniform(0.0, 5.0, 250)
print(x)
