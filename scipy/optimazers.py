# Optimizers in SciPy
# Optimizers are a set of procedures defined in SciPy that either
# find the minimum value of a function, or the root of an equation.

# Optimizing Functions
# Essentially, all of the algorithms in Machine Learning are nothing
# more than a complex equation that needs to be minimized with the help of given data.

# Roots of an Equation
# NumPy is capable of finding roots for polynomials and linear equations,
# but it can not find roots for non linear equations, like this one:
# x + cos(x)
# For that you can use SciPy's optimze.root function.
# This function takes two required arguments:
# fun - a function representing an equation.
# x0 - an initial guess for the root.
# The function returns an object with information regarding the solution.
# The actual solution is given under attribute x of the returned object:
from scipy.optimize import root
from math import cos

def op(x):
    return x + cos(x)
y = root(op, 0)
print(y)
print(y.x)


# Minimizing a Function
# A function, in this context, represents a curve, curves have high points and low points.
# High points are called maxima.
# Low points are called minima.
# The highest point in the whole curve is called global maxima, whereas the rest of them are called local maxima.
# The lowest point in whole curve is called global minima, whereas the rest of them are called local minima.
# Finding Minima
# We can use scipy.optimize.minimize() function to minimize the function.
# The minimize() function takes the following arguments:
# fun - a function representing an equation.
# x0 - an initial guess for the root.
# method - name of the method to use. Legal values:
#     'CG'
#     'BFGS'
#     'Newton-CG'
#     'L-BFGS-B'
#     'TNC'
#     'COBYLA'
#     'SLSQP'
# callback - function called after each iteration of optimization.
# options - a dictionary defining extra params:
# {
#      "disp": boolean - print detailed description
#      "gtol": number - the tolerance of the error
#   }
# Minimize the function x^2 + x + 2 with BFGS:

from scipy.optimize import minimize
def eqn(x):
  return x**2 + x + 2
mymin = minimize(eqn, 0, method='BFGS')
print(mymin)
